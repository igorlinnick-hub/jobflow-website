const QUESTIONS = [
  {
    q: "Will this get my account banned?",
    a: "No. HireDrop applies from your own browser at a human pace — the same way you would, just faster. We never crack captchas or run server bots that platforms flag, and built-in daily limits keep everything human-paced.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does auto-apply work?",
    a: "The Chrome extension reads matching listings, fills the application form with your profile, attaches your resume, and writes a tailored cover letter — then submits from your own browser. By default you review each one before it sends; switch to auto anytime.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which platforms are supported?",
    a: "Indeed and ZipRecruiter today, plus thousands of company application forms via their ATS (Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, Ashby). More platforms are being added.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are Apply Modes?",
    a: "You choose how selective the AI is: Broad (explore widely), Standard (focused by specialty), or Precise (only the best-matched roles). It's quality over volume — apply where you actually fit.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will my applications look spammy?",
    a: "No. A fresh resume and cover letter are tailored to each role and submitted one at a time at natural timing — not hundreds of identical blasts. Employers see a normal application, no HireDrop branding.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is my data secure?",
    a: "Yes. Data is stored on Supabase with row-level security and resumes are in encrypted storage. We never sell your data.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does it cost?",
    a: "Your first 40 applications are free. After that it's $9/week or $29/month — the full product on both, cancel anytime. Weekly is great while you're actively searching; monthly is better value if it runs longer. Have a promo code? Enter it at signup for free access.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is the free version really free?",
    a: "Yes — your first 40 applications cost nothing and there's no credit card at signup. That's real auto-apply with AI cover letters, not a demo. The only paid-only feature is ATS resume tailoring. When the 40 are used, you subscribe to keep applying — so you only ever pay after you've watched it work.",
