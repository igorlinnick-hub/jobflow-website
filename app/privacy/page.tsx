              <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">1. Information We Collect</h2>
              <p>We collect information you provide directly: name, email, resume PDF, job preferences, and writing style samples. We also collect activity data such as which jobs you applied to, application timestamps, and per-platform application counts.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
              <p>Your data is used to: find matching jobs, generate personalized cover letters via the Anthropic Claude API, submit applications on your behalf, and surface usage statistics in your dashboard. We never sell your personal data to third parties.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">3. The HireDrop Chrome Extension</h2>
              <p>The HireDrop Chrome extension runs only on indeed.com and on the HireDrop dashboard domain. On indeed.com it reads job titles, company names, and form fields, then uses your stored profile to autofill the application; it submits an application only after you explicitly start a campaign in the extension popup or on the dashboard.</p>
              <p className="mt-2">The extension stores your Supabase session token in <code>chrome.storage.local</code> so it can authenticate API requests; this token never leaves your browser except when calling the HireDrop backend. Cached profile data is stored for 5 minutes to reduce API load. No data is shared with any third party other than the HireDrop backend, the Anthropic API (cover letters), and Supabase (storage).</p>
              <p className="mt-2">HireDrop is not affiliated with Indeed. Users are solely responsible for ensuring their use of automation tools complies with Indeed&apos;s terms of service and any other platform&apos;s terms they apply on.</p>

              <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">4. Data Storage & Security</h2>
              <p>Your data is stored in Supabase with row-level security so each user can only access their own rows. Resume PDFs are stored in a private Supabase Storage bucket keyed by your user ID and downloaded only by the backend during application submissions. All transport is HTTPS.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">5. Third-Party Services</h2>
              <p>We use Supabase (auth + Postgres + Storage), Anthropic Claude (cover letter generation), Google OAuth (optional sign-in), Vercel (website hosting and cookieless, aggregate analytics), Resend (transactional email such as password resets), Stripe (payment processing when you purchase a subscription), and the job platforms and application systems you apply through (Indeed, ZipRecruiter, and company applicant-tracking systems such as Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, and Ashby). We share with each only the data needed for its function. We do not use advertising trackers or cross-site advertising pixels.</p>

            <section>
              <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">6. Your Rights</h2>
              <p>You can view and update your personal data at any time through your account settings. To delete your account and personal data, email support@hiredrop.io from your account email address. We will erase your profile, resume, application history, and stored sessions within 30 days, except where retention is required by law (for example, billing records).</p>
