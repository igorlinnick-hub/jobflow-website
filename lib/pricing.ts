// The backend is the source of truth: app/billing_config.py in the jobflow repo defines
// PLANS (weekly / monthly) and the Stripe Price IDs built from them. These constants must

// is how three different truths about pricing existed at once on 2026-09-04.

// Changing a price: edit billing_config.py, run `scripts/stripe_bootstrap.py ship` (it
// creates a NEW Stripe Price and transfers the lookup key — Stripe Prices are immutable),
// then update the two numbers here.
